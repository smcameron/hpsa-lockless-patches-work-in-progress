======================================

Work in progress snapshots of patchsets for lockless hpsa linux kernel driver

Note: the patchsets here should be considered as works in
progress, likely full of debug code, messy patches, and 
applying these patches will result in an experimental
driver which is apt to eat your data.  You have been warned.
